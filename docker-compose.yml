services: 
  #app is the service that's going to run our docker file
  app:
    #build: context: . build the docker file inside of our current directory
   build:
     context: .
     args:
       - DEV=true
    #maps port 8000 on local machine to 8000 on the container - this is how we can access the network when connecting to server
   ports:
     - "8000:8000"
    #how we map directories from our system into container. Here we're mapping app dir we created in project to /app in container 
    #Changes/updates made in local project reflected in running container in realtime. We don't want to rebuild image just for this
   volumes:
     - ./app:/app
    #Command used to run the service. We can override this command we we run docker-compose run. This command here will be default
    #if no command is specified with docker-compose run 
   command: >
    sh -c "python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000"
